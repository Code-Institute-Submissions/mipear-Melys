# Introduction

Melys is an e-commerce business, located in South Wales, creating honey and beeswax products. Please note some of these products are not yet created by Melys and have been created for the purpose of this project. The purpose of this website is to sell Melys’ range of products and to create a portfolio for its owner. Melys will have a personable feel to the website, emphasising that this is a small, ethical, and local business. Users can buy a range of products from the website, such as honey or candles, and users can find out more about the bees and owner that created the products. Melys also offers beekeeping workshops, presented by the owner of Melys, and users can sign up through the website if interested.

# User Experience, Research and Design

## Strategy

The purpose of this website is to primarily sell products and promote the site owner’s beekeeping business. For this, the website should have a beekeeping ‘feel’ to it, offering a personable service. In order to understand and create the best user experience, I looked at several honey/beekeeping related websites in order to understand best practice. Here are a couple that helped me in my research:

[Honey Bee Beautiful](https://www.honeybeebeautiful.co.uk/collections/)
gave me a good idea of how I would like my products to appear on the page, along with the language to use in regards to products and descriptions.

[Bees In The D](https://beesinthed.com/) is a NGO that has a focus on “saving the bees”, but it also sells a range of products such as honey, books, clothes, and tours. Its focus on educating audiences prior to selling is useful when creating Melys, as it’s important for users to initially know a little about the business and its owner and bees, before buying its products. Melys should build a level of reliability in order to ensure users both invest in the business through buying products, but also emotionally investing in Melys.

Melys’ target audience, then, are both potential beekeepers and people interested in buying beekeeping products. While, it’s important to entice users through promoting beekeeping, it’s important not to alienate users either by focusing only on beekeeping. The website should have a good e-commerce experience by providing an easy, efficient navigation and checkout system for all users, just like the websites listed above.

Of course, when researching this website, the most influential and important factor in the design and goals of this website was the business owner. Melys’ owner stated that her main goals for this site are the following:

“Sell my products, especially my honey and candles. To promote beekeeping as a hobby and increase interest. I’d like to position myself within the beekeeping community.” 

It is imperative, then, that these needs are considered and met when designing and implementing this website.

## Scope

The scope of this project is partly dependent on the project requirements for [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+DIWAD_MS4+2022_Q1/courseware/5cc55f6df9fe41cc8dcb4d665a251ded/8341150079674a76b87da0143c45f6f9/) and partly dependent on the site owner’s goals as this will be used as a functional e-commerce website.

Code Institute has required the following for this website:

“
1. Django Full Stack Project: Build a Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
2. Multiple Apps: The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps..
3. Data Modeling: Put some effort into designing a relational database schema well-suited for your domain.
4. Create at least 2 custom django models beyond the examples shown on the course
5. User Authentication: The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in.
6. User Interaction: Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend.
7. Use of Stripe: At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. 
8. Structure and Navigation: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout”

Therefore, the website will have a relational database with custom django models, user authentication, and a payment system. Melys gives a perfect opportunity to do this, offering beekeeping products to sell and workshops for users to apply to. Authentication becomes a necessary component as users who wish to purchase something must log in first.
